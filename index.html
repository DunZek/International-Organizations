                            <h3>The Evaluation</h3>
                            <p>Britain joined the European Economic Comunity on January 1, 1973, and left the European Union on January 31, 2020. Mostly, Britain joined the EEC to avoid stagnation within their economy.</p>
                            <p>Brexit was an example of how the European Union failed to meet the needs and wants of one of its constituent members. The British government and people believed that remaining within the European Union was hampering Britain's economic success. They became skeptical of using Euro's for example. The Euro did not meet Britain's requirements for it to be used as Britain's currency, it had failed the "five-test" policy, which was a test that was used to determine if the Euro is acceptible enough to replace the very successful British pound. One of the reasons why Britain is skeptical of the EU is because of the Union's economic performance during the 2008 economic crash.</p>
                            <p>Without getting to focused on Brexit, let's just say that the European Union isn't a perfect international organization and possesses its own strengths, weaknesses, successes and failures.</p>
                            <p>The European Union will be judged in its effectiveness according to the following criteria:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Clearly established, worthwhile goals,</li>
                                <li>Evidence of success in meeting its goals and whether if there are any notable failures,</li>
                                <li>Responsiveness to its stakeholders' needs,</li>
                                <li>and indicators of long-term or sustainable results.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>The European Union</h3>
                            <p>The European Union is a unique economic and political union between 27 EU countries that together cover much of the continent.</p>
                            <p>The EU is unofficially headquartered in Brussels, Belgium. The EU was established in 1993 during the Maastricht Treaty in the Netherlands. Even though the de facto capital is in Brussels, Belgium, however, the EU does not have
                                a headquarters in any of the member countries. In addition, there are no plans in place for choosing a headquarter city.</p>
                            <p>In summary, the purpose of the EU was to ensure a single free market among its constituents using free movement and common trade policies. The Euro was used by 19 member countries. Within the Schengen Area, movement between
                                countries is possible without a passport.</p>

                            <p>The European Union is the largest trade block in the world. It is the world's biggest exporter of manufactured goods and services, and the biggest import market for over 100 countries.</p>
                            <h3>Humanitarian Aid</h3>
                            <p>The EU is committed to helping victims of man-made and natural disasters worldwide and supports over 120 million people each year. Collectively, the EU and its constituent countries are the world's leading donor of humanitarian
                                aid.

                            <p>The EU plays an important role in diplomacy and works to foster stability, security and prosperity, democracy, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law at international level.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Promote peace, its values and the well-being of its citizens.</li>

                                </li>
                                <li>Combat social exclusion and discrimination.

                            <p>These goals and values form the basis of the EU and are laid out in the Lisbon Treaty and the EU Charter of fundamental rights. </p>
                            <h4>An excerpt from the preamble of the EU Charter of fundamental rights</h4>
                            <p>"The peoples of Europe, in creating an ever closer union among them, are resolved to share a peaceful future based on common values. Conscious of its spiritual and moral heritage, the Union is founded on the indivisible, universal
                                values of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity; it is based on the principles of democracy and the rule of law. It places the individual at the heart of its activities, by establishing the citizenship of the
                                Union and by creating an area of freedom, security and justice."</p>

                            <h3>Values</h3>
                            <p>The EU values are common to the EU countries in a society in which inclusion, tolerance, justice, solidarity and non-discrimination prevail. These values are an integral part of our European way of life:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <h4>Human Dignity</h4>
                                    <p>Human dignity is inviolable. It must be respected, protected and constitutes the real basis of fundamental rights.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h4>Freedom</h4>
                                    <p>Freedom of movement gives citizens the right to move and reside freely within the Union. Individual freedoms such as respect for private life, freedom of thought, religion, assembly, expression and information are protected
                                        by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>

                                    <h4>Democracy</h4>
                                    <p>The functioning of the EU is founded on representative democracy. Being a European citizen also means enjoying political rights. Every adult EU citizen has the right to stand as a candidate and to vote in elections
                                        to the European Parliament. EU citizens have the right to stand as candidate and to vote in their country of residence, or in their country of origin.</p>

                                    <h4>Equality</h4>
                                    <p>Equality is about equal rights for all citizens before the law. The principle of equality between women and men underpins all European policies and is the basis for European integration. It applies in all areas. The
                                        principle of equal pay for equal work became part of the Treaty of Rome in 1957. Although inequalities still exist, the EU has made significant progress.</p>

                                    <h4>Rule of law</h4>
                                    <p>The EU is based on the rule of law. Everything the EU does is founded on treaties, voluntarily and democratically agreed by its EU countries. Law and justice are upheld by an independent judiciary. The EU countries
                                        gave final jurisdiction to the European Court of Justice which judgements have to be respected by all.</p>

                                    <p>Human rights are protected by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. These cover the right to be free from discrimination on the basis of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation,
                                        the right to the protection of your personal data, and or the right to get access to justice.

                            <h3>History of the EU</h3>
                            <p>The predecessor of the EU was created in the aftermath of the Second World War. The first steps were to foster economic cooperation: the idea being that countries that trade with one another become economically interdependent
                                and so more likely to avoid conflict.</p>
                            <p>The result was the European Economic Community (EEC), created in 1958, and initially increasing economic cooperation between six countries: Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.</p>
                            <p>Since then, 22 other members joined and a huge single market (also known as the 'internal' market) has been created and continues to develop towards its full potential.</p>
                            <p>What began as a purely economic union has evolved into an organization spanning policy areas, from climate, environment and health to external relations and security, justice and migration. A name change from the European Economic
                                Community (EEC) to the European Union (EU) in 1993 reflected this.</p>
                            <h3>Over the decades</h3>
                            <h4>1945 - 1959: A peaceful Europe – the beginnings of cooperation</h4>
                            <p>The plans for an international organization that culminated to be the European Union started as a desperate decision to stop mindless and bloody wars that were frequently fought in Europe. The European Coal and Steel Community were the first steps during the 1950s. Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands were the six founding countries. In 1957, as the cold war started to boil, the Treaty of Rome created the European Economic Community (EEC), or ‘Common Market’.</p>
                            <h4>1960 - 1969: A period of economic growth</h4>
                            <p>EU countries stopped charging custom duties with each other during the 1960s. They’ve also agreed to place importance on food production so that everyone could eat. In May 1968, civil unrest occurred once again throughout France. This time, students and workers caused unrest which would help push France into the modern age.
                            </p>
                            <h4>1970 - 1979: A growing Community – the first enlargement</h4>
                            <p>Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom joined the European Union on 1 January 1973, raising the number of Member States to nine. The EU regional policy starts to transfer huge sums of money to create jobs and infrastructure in poorer areas. The European Parliament increases its influence in EU affairs and in 1979 all citizens can, for the first time, elect their members directly. The fight against pollution intensified in the 1970s. The EU adopts laws to protect the environment, introducing the notion of ‘the polluter pays’ for the first time.
                            </p>
                            <h4>1980 - 1989: The changing face of Europe - the fall of the Berlin Wall</h4>
                            <p>In 1981, Greece became the 10th member of the EU, and Spain and Portugal followed five years later. In 1986 the Single European Act was signed. This is a treaty which provides the basis for a vast six-year programme aimed at sorting out the problems with the free flow of trade across EU borders and thus creates the ‘Single Market’. There is major political upheaval when, on 9 November 1989, the Berlin Wall is pulled down and the border between East and West Germany is opened for the first time in 28 years. This led to the reunification of Germany, when both East and West Germany were united in October 1990.
                            </p>
                            <h4>1990 - 1999: A Europe without frontier</h4>
                            <p>With the collapse of communism across central and eastern Europe, Europeans become closer neighbours. In 1993 the Single Market was completed with the 'four freedoms' of: movement of goods, services, people and money. The 1990s is also the decade of two treaties: the ‘Maastricht’ Treaty on European Union in 1993 and the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1999. People are concerned about how to protect the environment and also how Europeans can act together when it comes to security and defence matters. In 1995 the EU gained three more new members: Austria, Finland and Sweden. A small village in Luxembourg gives its name to the ‘Schengen’ agreements that gradually allow people to travel without having their passports checked at the borders. Millions of young people study in other countries with EU support. Communication is made easier as more and more people start using mobile phones and the internet.</p>
                            <h4>2000 - 2009: Further expansion</h4>
                            <p>The euro is now the new currency for many Europeans. During the decade more and more countries adopted the euro. 11 September 2001 became synonymous with the 'War on Terror' after hijacked airliners were flown into buildings in New York and Washington. EU countries begin to work much more closely together to fight crime. The political divisions between east and west Europe are finally declared healed when no fewer than 10 new countries join the EU in 2004, followed by Bulgaria and Romania in 2007. A financial crisis hit the global economy in September 2008. The Treaty of Lisbon was ratified by all EU countries before entering into force in 2009. It provides the EU with modern institutions and more efficient working methods.</p>

                            <h3>Initatives taken by the EU</h3>
                            <p>The EU has delivered more than half a century of peace, stability and prosperity, helped raise living standards and launched a single European currency: the euro. More than 340 million EU citizens in 19 countries now use it
                                as their currency and enjoy its benefits.</p>
                            <p>Thanks to the abolition of border controls between EU countries, people can travel freely throughout most of the continent. And it has become much easier to live, work and travel abroad in Europe. All EU citizens have the right
                                and freedom to choose in which EU country they want to study, work or retire. Every EU country must treat EU citizens in exactly the same way as its own citizens for employment, social security and tax purposes.
                            </p>
                            <img src="/dist/img/70years.jpg" alt="" class="stuff-img">
                            <p>The EU has achieved a lot. For example, it has built a single market based on ‘four freedoms’, with people, goods, services and capital moving freely between all Member States. The single market means that over 500 million
                                EU citizens are free to move and settle where they wish in the Union. The EU has created a single currency, the euro, which is now a major world currency and which makes the single market more efficient. It has also created
                                the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which protects certain political, social and economic rights for EU citizens and residents. The EU has also led the way in protecting the environment and tackling
                                climate change. These are just a few of the achievements so far.

                            <h3>Transparent and democratic institutions
                            </h3>
                            <p>The EU remains focused on making its governing institutions more transparent and democratic. Decisions are taken as openly as possible and as closely as possible to the citizen.</p>
                            <p>More powers have been given to the directly elected European Parliament, while national parliaments play a greater role, working alongside the European institutions.</p>
                            <p>The EU is governed by the principle of representative democracy, with citizens directly represented at Union level in the European Parliament and Member States represented in the European Council and the Council of the EU.
                            </p>
                            <p>European citizens are encouraged to contribute to the democratic life of the Union by giving their views on EU policies during their development or suggest improvements to existing laws and policies. The European citizens' initiative empowers citizens to have a greater say on EU policies that affect their lives. Citizens can also submit complaints and enquiries concerning the application of EU law.
                            </p>
                            <h4>In summary</h4>
                            <p>The European Union is without doubt, a successful international organization. Europe prospered economically and had become politically in union with each other than perhaps otherwise. The goals of the European Union are aligned with that of its predecessor, the European Economic Community. For more than 70 years, Europe achieved a state of peace never before seen within Human history. While Europe prospered under the EU's control, the Union's mission is not over yet. Tension still runs rampant within the Balkans. Much of the economic damage dealt during the 2008 economic crash left many doubting of the EU's capabilities to manage international crises. Brexit is another example of how the EU failed to meet the needs and wants of its members.</p>
                            <p>However, in the end, the European Union provided an alternative to the notion of everlasting peace within Europe like no other during its time. Perhaps it is still our best solution for attaining world peace and prosperity.</p>

                            <h4>Clearly established, worthwhile goals</h4>
                            <p>The leaders of the European Union's primary goal was to establish peace within Europe, or at least within its constituent members. The second goal was to achieve prosperity within aforementioned group. Subsequent goals and values were then laid out to pursue peace and prosperity. In summary, the values of the EU were:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Human dignity</li>
                                <li>Freedom</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>Specifically, the goals of the EU are:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Promote peace, its values and the well-being of its citizens.</li>
                                <li>Offer freedom, security and justice without internal borders.
                                </li>
                                <li>Sustainable development based on balanced economic growth and price stability, a highly competitive market economy with full employment and social progress, and environmental protection.</li>
                                <li>Combat social exclusion and discrimination.
                                </li>
                                <li>Promote scientific and technological progress.
                                </li>
                                <li>Enhance economic, social and territorial cohesion and solidarity among EU countries.
                                </li>
                                <li>Respect its rich cultural and linguistic diversity.
                                </li>
                                <li>Establish an economic and monetary union whose currency is the euro.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Evidence of success in meeting its goals</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Economic prosperity:
                                    <p>Economic goals of the EU include sustainable development based on balanced economic growth and price stability, a highly competitive market economy with full employment and social progress, and environmental protection.Enhance economic, social and territorial cohesion and solidarity among EU countries. One tool the EU uses 
                                        
                                        The EU establish an economic and monetary union whose currency is the euro between 19 out of 27 members. This is economically advantageous as using a single currency eliminates fluctuations between exchange rates between different currencies. It also allows for price transparency, which allows businesses within different EU countries to remain competitive with each other and consumers to tell good deals from bad deals. Because of the euro, tourists for example are not required to waste time and money from exchange-transaction costs. Within business, this also makes trade more feasible between different EU countries.</p>
                                    
                                    </p>When promoting scientific and technological progress, the EU encourages cooperation between researcg teams across countries and dicsciplines. The EU's multiannual research and innovation framewok programmes strengthen the europe's position in science, strengthen industrial innovation, address major social concerns such as climate change and renewable energy,ensure technological breakthroughs are developed into viable products with real commercial potential by building partnerships with industry and governments, and to step up international cooperation on research & innovation. One of these programmes for example is Horizon 2020, it is the biggest EU Research and Innovation programme. It promises to deliver more scientific breakthroughs and discoveries by innovating scientific knowledge from laboratories into the market. </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>Peace and well-being within europe:
                                    <p>70 years of peace have been enforced in europe by the EU. The EU manages this peace based on their capacity to undertake missions, willingness to devote resources to security and defence purposes and acceptance of internal and external members for the EU to take responsibility.</p>
                                    <p>The EU is capable of undertaking missions because of its level of resources it garners through its influence and because of its command structure. The CSDP, or Common Security and Defence Policy strengthens the EU institutional framework, endowing it with strengthened capabilities in terms of political control and strategic command.</p>
                                    <p>Members willing to commit towards help the EU are driven by their national agenda to help themselves. The EU is able to make sure peace and security remains afloat in a member state because of the EU's support garnered from the support of its constituents, whether it be in resource, intelligence, or stratigic command.</p>
                                    <p>The third factor, relates to the importance of the acceptance of the EU’s actions and its potential to play a relevant role in maintaining global peace and security. The support of European citizens is of utmost importance, as it provides the EU with leverage in terms of authority at the global level, as well as positively influencing member states’ willingness to engage their resources in EU entreprises.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>How the European Union met its values</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <p>No country may join the European Union without upholding the aforementioned values. Thus, every member of the European Union are pluralistic. Nobody may be discriminated against; instead, people and government representatives must respect others and be tolerant. Everybody must be treated fairly. Minority rights must be respected. Equality between men and women is promoted. Responsibility must be shared.</p>
                                <p>The European Union works for social equality. It develops social security and tries to protect the weakest. It seeks to prevent social exclusion and discrimination.

                                    All these fundamental values are defined in the Treaty of Lisbon Lissabonin sopimuksessa (2009).
                                    
                                    The Treaty of Lisbon officially confirmed the universal citizens’ rights as well as political, economic and social rights.
                                    
                                    The Charter of Fundamental Rights forbids discrimination because of gender, race or the colour of the skin. Also, discrimination based on religion or sexual orientation is forbidden.</p>
                                <p>Additionally, the Charter of Fundamental Rights defines rights to data security, bioethics and good administration. It obligates employers to look after their employees. For example, employees have the right to access information, negotiate and go on strike.</p>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Responsiveness to stakeholders' needs</h4>
                            <p>In summary, the EU today holds great amount of power, and this is because of the collective sum of all the support and management offered by the core of its powers, the 27 constituent member nations.</p>
                            <p>Throughout history, the EU had upheld most of its goals and values. While the 21st century hit EU with the 2008 recession and Brexit, the EU remains rumbling along. Considering how much it has grown from the 20th century, having procured 21 members from the day of its foundation in 1951, it is safe to say that the EU had met with most of its stakeholders' needs. If that were not the case, then it would have been impossible for 20+ countries to be able to cooperate with each other on a large scale.</p>
                            <p>Currently, how EU is facing the COVID-19 with Italy is quite mediocre. The problem currently is that the EU had failed to support Italy during these times. The mismanagement of border controls and banning of export of necessary medical supplies are just some of the failures the EU had to deal with. This, all the meanwhile China had been providing more help to Italy than the EU itself. This has left large sums of EU opposition within Italy.</p>
                            <p>The EU today is facing greater and greater challenges, challenges that would seem to repeat history itself. Because the EU is not able to collectivize debt, it is not able to assist Italy economically, which resulted in a big blow to Italy's economically during the pandemic. We can be sympathetic towards the northern nations who do not want to partake in perhaps, one of the biggest recessions on record.</p>
                            <p>In summary, while the EU is held with prestige due to its expanded power, influence, and instigations to raise the quality of life within europe, it holds weaknesses and is faced with difficult challenges just like with any other international organization.</p>
                            <h4>Indicators of long-term or sustainable results</h4>
